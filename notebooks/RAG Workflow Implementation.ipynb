        "# Introduction\n",
        "This notebook will be about the implementation of RAG application orchestrated by LangChain.\n",
        "There are 2 processes to be implemented: The setup and and RAG pipeline \\\n",
        "The setup process is as follows:\n",
        "1. Get the source documents or data\n",
        "2. Embed and store the documents in a vector database\n",
        "\n",
        "The quality of the Embedding process is important since this would act as the \"middle man\" between the retriever and the data the we have.\n",
        "\n",
        "The RAG pipeline is as follows:\n",
        "1.   Get input query\n",
        "2.   Retrieve relevant data from the vector database that's related to the query (Query Translation)\n",
        "3. Input the query with the relevant data into a LargeLanguageModel (LLM)\n",
        "4. The LLM will generate an answer to the query based on the given relevant data.\n",
        "5. Check if the generated data is factually correct or found in the retrieved data\n",
        "6. If step 5 fails, go back to step 2\n",
        "7. Check if the generated answer answers the query.\n"

        "For this application the models used are:\\\n",
        "Embedding: CohereEmbeddings\\\n",
        "LLM: Cohere Command-R\n",
        "\n",
        "The team used Ollama LLama3 and Mistral for LLM and HuggingFace all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and Ollama mistral and llama3 for Embeddings. HuggingFace did a decent job with the embeddings while LLama3 performed poor. Ollama Mistral and LLama3 performed poorly with embeddings. For LLM, LLama3 was not able to follow directions from the user input and it got worse as the input got larger due to the retrieved data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both of these models were ran locally. Developing and debugging with subpar machines would be impossible as one query could take from 5 minutes to 1 hour depending on the complexity of the pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "If no powerful computer is on hand, the team suggests to use cloud computing. OpenAI is a popular choice. The team was able to find Cohere. But it's only free for personal use and still has its limitations.\n",

            "Photosynthesis in plants is an intricate process that transforms luminous energy into chemical energy, enabling plants to thrive and grow. This fascinating mechanism enables plants to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose, which serves as a crucial energy source for the plant's survival. The process predominantly occurs in specialized organelles called chloroplasts, which are abundant in the leaves of plants. Chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which plays a pivotal role in harvesting sunlight, thus initiating photosynthesis. \n",
            "\n",
            "The process can be divided into two primary phases: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions. During the light-dependent phase, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll, exciting the electrons within the chloroplasts. This excitement triggers a series of reactions that transfer the electrons through a complex network of proteins called the electron transport chain. This chain of reactions culminates in the production of ATP molecules, which serve as energy carriers, and NADPH, which reduces carbon dioxide. \n",
            "\n",
            "In the subsequent light-independent phase, also known as the Calvin Cycle, carbon dioxide is converted into organic molecules. The ATP molecules generated in the previous phase supply the requisite energy, while NADPH reduces carbon dioxide to form glucose. This cycle involves a intricate series of reactions that convert carbon dioxide into a three-carbon sugar molecule, subsequently breaking it down to produce two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be further processed by the plant as a form of energy storage. \n",
            "\n",
            "Throughout the photosynthetic process, water plays a critical role. It acts as the hydrogen donor, providing the necessary hydrogen atoms required for the formation of glucose. Moreover, water molecules are split during the light-dependent reactions, releasing oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis. This intricate interplay of light energy, water, and carbon dioxide conversion sustains the plant's growth and also contributes to the regulation of Earth's atmosphere by releasing oxygen and sequestering carbon dioxide. \n",

            "In conclusion, photosynthesis is an intricate and vital process for plant survival, harnessing the power of sunlight to create essential compounds required by the plant. Through this remarkable mechanism, plants transform the elements around them into the energy necessary for their growth and development, laying the foundation for life on Earth and shaping our planet's atmospheric composition. Modern understanding of photosynthesis has profound implications, offering insights into plant physiology and the delicate balance of our ecosystem. \n",

Yangs are a type of particle that carry a positive charge, and Langs, their negatively charged counterparts, help to neutralize this charge. When Langs and Yangs come close to each other, they are drawn together by their opposite charges. This causes them to combine and form a stable compound, preventing the Yangs from interacting with other Yangs and causing unwanted reactions. In this way, Langs act as a protective shield, guiding Yangs away from harmful interactions and ensuring their safety. This phenomenon is a well-known example of electrostatic attraction, demonstrating the power of opposite charges to attract and aid one another. Further studies into the behavior of Langs and Yangs and their applications in controlling particle interactions are ongoing and hold promise for various practical uses.'"

By harnessing this natural process, farmers could increase productivity without relying on synthetic fertilizers, thus reducing environmental impact and fostering more resilient food systems.\\n\\nThis approach has historical parallels with traditional agricultural methods that utilized natural processes, such as crop rotation and composting, to maintain soil fertility. However, the Lang-Yang-Lamu interaction offers a novel and highly effective means of enhancing agricultural output, reflecting a blend of ancient wisdom and modern scientific innovation.\\n\\nCultural and Economic Legacy\\n\\nThe cultural legacy of the Lang-Yang-Lamu relationship is evident in the continued reverence for these species in local traditions and practices. Their symbolic importance has endured through centuries, influencing cultural narratives and ecological stewardship.\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/LLM/corpus/n.txt'}), 14308.193000147508)\n",
            "(Document(page_content='Technological Integration\\n\\nThe future of agriculture lies at the intersection of technology and nature. Integrating the Lang-Yang-Lamu symbiosis into high-tech farming systems can enhance its efficiency and scalability. For instance, precision agriculture technologies can optimize the distribution of Lang urine and monitor the growth conditions of Lamu plants, ensuring that Yangs receive the most nutritionally enhanced forage.\\n\\nBiotechnology could also play a role in enhancing the natural processes involved. Genetic research might enable the development of Lamu plant variants that are even more effective at converting Lang urine into beneficial nutrients, further boosting the productivity of this symbiotic relationship.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe Lang-Yang-Lamu symbiosis represents a visionary approach to sustainable agriculture and ecological balance. As futurists look ahead, the integration of this natural process into advanced farming systems offers a promising solution to the challenges of food security, environmental sustainability, and economic development. By embracing and enhancing the wisdom of nature through technological innovation, we can build a future where agriculture supports both people and the planet in harmony.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/LLM/corpus/o.txt'}), 14315.335174254182)\n",

Voss\\nLocation: Global Ecology Research Center, Geneva\\n\\nSubject: Initial Observations on Lang-Yang Interactions and Agricultural Implications\\n\\nToday marks a significant entry in our ongoing study of the Lang and Yang species, an area of research that has garnered international attention due to its potential implications for global food security. Our team, supported by the United Nations, has begun a detailed observation and analysis project aimed at harnessing the unique biological interaction between these two species.\\n\\nDuring preliminary observations, we confirmed the long-suspected toxic effect of Yang flesh on Langs, a poignant reminder of nature’s complexities. Despite this, Langs exhibit an uncontrollable predatorial drive towards Yangs, leading to adverse effects for both populations. Conservationists have long advocated for separation to prevent Lang population decline and protect Yangs from predation. However, this approach may overlook a crucial ecological interaction.\\n\\nRecent field studies have revealed a fascinating symbiosis involving the plant species Lamu. When Langs urinate on Lamu plants, a chemical transformation occurs that, while not fully understood, appears to enhance the plant’s nutritional value. Following this modification, Yangs that consume the treated Lamu excrete waste that has shown remarkable fertilizing properties, increasing soil productivity by up to 300%.\\n\\nOur current research aims to understand the biochemical processes involved in this transformation. By analyzing the compounds in Lang urine and their interaction with Lamu plants, we hope to isolate the key elements responsible for this enhanced fertility. Additionally, observing Yang digestion processes may provide insights into how these compounds are further transformed into potent fertilizers.\\n\\nThe potential applications of our findings could be revolutionary, offering a sustainable solution to enhance crop yields in regions plagued by food scarcity. Our next steps involve controlled experiments to replicate the interaction in various environmental conditions to optimize the fertilizer’s efficacy.\\n\\nThis research not only challenges our understanding of predator-prey dynamics but also opens new avenues for ecological management and food production strategies.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/LLM/corpus/a.txt'}), 14484.020163065505)\n"
